# Data files (if large or frequently changing)
data/  # Or specific data files like: data/large_dataset.csv

# Documentation build outputs
docs/_build/

# OS-specific files
.Thumbs.db
desktop.ini

# Packages and dependencies (if you're managing them manually)
# If using requirements.txt, you generally don't need to ignore these
# But if you're NOT using requirements.txt or pip freeze, you might
# want to ignore specific package folders

# Example:
# my_package/

# Things you should almost NEVER ignore (double-check these!)
# .gitignore itself (obviously!)
# Your main application code files (.py)
# Configuration files (unless they contain secrets - use .env instead)
# README, LICENSE, etc.

# If you have specific files or folders that you *do* want to include
# even if they match a pattern above, you can use the ! (exclamation mark)

# Example:
# data/small_sample.csv  # Ignore everything in data/ except this file
#!data/small_sample.csv


# If you have a folder like 'tests' but want to ignore a subfolder within it:
# tests/integration/data/
#!tests/integration/data/.keep  # But keep the .keep file if it's a placeholder.

# For Jupyter Notebooks, you might want to ignore checkpoint files:
.ipynb_checkpoints/
